# Turtle Race Game

Welcome to the Turtle Race Game. Players bet on which turtle they believe will win the race. Each turtle competes by moving random distances towards the finish line.

## Getting Started

To play the Turtle Race Game, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer, along with the Turtle Graphics and Tkinter libraries. This game runs on a simple graphical interface and requires user interaction for betting and game progression.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library (usually comes with Python)
- Tkinter Library (for GUI elements)

### Installation

No additional installation is required if you have Python 3.x installed. The Turtle Graphics and Tkinter libraries are included with Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the script to start the game.
2. A prompt will ask you to bet on a turtle by entering the color of the turtle you think will win.
3. Watch the race unfold. The turtles will move towards the finish line at random speeds.
4. A message box will pop up at the end of the race to let you know if you've won or lost based on your bet.
5. You will be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit the game.
